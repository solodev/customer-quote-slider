# customer-quote-slider
Credibility on the web is absolutely paramount in achieving your digital goals. One of the best ways to establish credibility on your website is to display customer logos which indicate to website visitors what caliber of clients you've worked for. However, there is no context to these logos. The website visitor simply knows that your company provided a product or service for that brand and have no idea if the engagement was a success or failure, nor does the logo provide any statistics to display any success in the engagement.  In our example, we will teach you how to add a customer quote slider to your website that adds context to your customer roster. Instead of logos, the slider will display actual quotes from customers further establishing your credibility and providing site visitors with specific instances of success that they are more likely to relate to and as a result, engage with your business.
